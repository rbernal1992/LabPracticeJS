LabPractice Javascript
1.	You need to add the JavaScript functionality so that when typing a New Todo and then clicking on the button of Post Todo the given Todo must be added to the List of Todo’s.
2.	Each individual item added to the list must have a checkbox. Its purpose is to check the Todo’s that you have completed.
3.	Once finished with the Post Todo you will need to add the JavaScript functionality so that when clicking in the button of Clear all Todo’s all the checkboxes are cleared out.
4.	Next, the functionality for the button of Mark all Todo’s should do the opposite as in Clear all Todo’s; you need to check all the checkboxes in the list.
5.	Finally you will have to add the JavaScript functionality to the button of Delete all Todo’s which will remove all the Todo’s from the list.
6.	Feel free to add any elements, classes or ids to the html.
7.	Feel free to modify the CSS file provided.
